    <p>When a priori knowledge is juxtaposed with transcendental nepotism the ensuing byproduct is a confused gerbil
        whose manacled mask of mirroring paradigms transforms its visage from one of innocuous innocence to one of
        petrified petulance, elapsing finally into an insane creature wholly unlike the one it had originally been until
        the existential crises that plague its one-dimensional soul incapable of grasping the reality that torments it
        is reduced to a pile of rubbish and dust, not unlike this hilariously bad, stupidly written, altogether
        incoherent and incohesive run-on.</p>
